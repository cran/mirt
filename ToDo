Roughly in order of importance:

- factor scores for polymirt and confmirt with standard errors
- multicore estimation of Monte carlo logliklihood
- nominal and rating intercept estimation for polymirt and confmirt
- add more extensive simulation data functions (different distributions, skew/kurtosis)
- multiple group estimation for DIF
