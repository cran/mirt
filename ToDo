Things to do:

- Parallel processing option for draw.thetas(), should work better now that the draws are done mainly in
R
- Multiple-group estimation for confmirt, now possible!
- Multilevel structure function using lme4 or nlme (via multimirt or confmirt extension )
- Add limited-information model fit statistics
