Multidimentional item response theory in R. 

##Description

Analysis of dichotomous and polychotomous response data using
latent trait models under the Item Response Theory paradigm. Includes
univariate and multivariate (MV) one-, two-, three-, and four-parameter
logistic models, graded response models, generalized partial credit models,
nominal models, and multivariate partially-compensatory models. These can
be used in an exploratory or confirmatory manner with optional user defined linear
constraints. Exploratory models can be estimated via quadrature or
stochastic methods, a generalized confirmatory bifactor analysis is
included, and confirmatory IRT models can be fit stochastically with an MH-RM algorithm 
and can include polynomial or product constructed latent traits.
