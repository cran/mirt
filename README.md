Multidimensional item response theory in R. 

##Description

Analysis of dichotomous and polytomous response data using latent
    trait models under the Item Response Theory paradigm. Includes univariate
    and multivariate one-, two-, three-, and four-parameter logistic models,
    graded response models, generalized partial credit models, nominal models,
    multiple choice models, and multivariate partially-compensatory models.
    These can be used in an exploratory or confirmatory manner with optional
    user defined linear constraints. Exploratory models can be estimated via
    quadrature or stochastic methods, a generalized confirmatory bi-factor
    analysis is included, and confirmatory models can be fit with a
    Metropolis-Hastings Robbins-Monro algorithm which can include polynomial or
    product constructed latent traits. Additionally, multiple group analysis may
    be performed for unidimensional or multidimensional item response models for
    detecting differential item functioning.
