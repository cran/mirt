\title{Description of SAT12 data}
\description{
Data obtained from the TESTFACT (Woods et al., 2003) manual, with 32 response pattern
scored items for a grade 12 science assessment test (SAT) measuring topics of chemistry,
biology, and physics. The scoring key for these data is
[1, 4, 5, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 5, 3, 4, 4, 1, 4, 3, 3, 4, 1, 3, 5, 1, 3, 1, 5, 4, 5],
respectively. However, careful analysis using the nominal response model suggests that the
scoring key for item 32 may be incorrect, and should be changed from 5 to 3.

\examples{

\dontrun{
#score the data (missing scored as 0)
head(SAT12)
data <- key2binary(SAT12,
    key = c(1,4,5,2,3,1,2,1,3,1,2,4,2,1,5,3,4,4,1,4,3,3,4,1,3,5,1,3,1,5,4,5))
head(data)

#score the data, missing (value of 8) treated as NA
SAT12missing <- SAT12
SAT12missing[SAT12missing == 8] <- NA
data <- key2binary(SAT12missing,
    key = c(1,4,5,2,3,1,2,1,3,1,2,4,2,1,5,3,4,4,1,4,3,3,4,1,3,5,1,3,1,5,4,5))
head(data)

#potentially better scoring for item 32 (based on nominal model finding)
data <- key2binary(SAT12,
    key = c(1,4,5,2,3,1,2,1,3,1,2,4,2,1,5,3,4,4,1,4,3,3,4,1,3,5,1,3,1,5,4,3))
