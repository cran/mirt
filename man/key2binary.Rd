\title{Score a test by converting response patterns to binary data}
\usage{
key2binary(fulldata, key, score_missing = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{fulldata}{an object of class \code{data.frame}, \code{matrix}, or
\code{table} with the response patterns}

\item{key}{a vector or matrix consisting of the 'correct' response to the items. Each
value/row corresponds to each column in \code{fulldata}. If the input is a matrix, multiple
scoring keys can be supplied for each item. NA values are used to indicate no scoring key (or
in the case of a matrix input, no additional scoring keys)}

\item{score_missing}{logical; should missing data elements be returned as incorrect (i.e., 0)?
If \code{FALSE}, all missing data terms will be kept as missing}
}
\value{
Returns a numeric matrix with all the response patterns in
  dichotomous format
}
\description{
The \code{key2binary} function will convert response pattern data to a
dichotomous format, given a response key.
}
\examples{

data(SAT12)
head(SAT12)
key <- c(1,4,5,2,3,1,2,1,3,1,2,4,2,1,5,3,4,4,1,4,3,3,4,1,3,5,1,3,1,5,4,5)

dicho.SAT12 <- key2binary(SAT12, key)
head(dicho.SAT12)

# multiple scoring keys
key2 <- cbind(c(1,4,5,2,3,1,2,1,3,1,2,4,2,1,5,3,4,4,1,4,3,3,4,1,3,5,1,3,1,5,4,5),
              c(2,3,NA,1,rep(NA, 28)))
dicho.SAT12 <- key2binary(SAT12, key2)

# keys from raw character responses
resp <- as.data.frame(matrix(c(
  "B","B","D","D","E",
  "B","A","D","D","E",
  "B","A","D","C","E",
  "D","D","D","C","E",
  "B","C","A","D","A"), ncol=5, byrow=TRUE))

key <- c("B", "D", "D", "C", "E")

d01 <- key2binary(resp, key)
head(d01)

# score/don't score missing values
resp[1,1] <- NA
d01NA <- key2binary(resp, key) # without scoring
d01NA

d01 <- key2binary(resp, key, score_missing = TRUE) # with scoring
d01
